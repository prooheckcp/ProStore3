# 📘Introduction

This library is composed by 5 different files.

From these files there are two that you should be looking at: the schema
a and the settings. These 2 files are what will decide the database format that you want and the settings that will go along with it.

ProStore is supposed to offer you a simple and fast way of setting up your dataStore. All you have to do is drag it into whatever root directory you want in Roblox (E.g ServerScriptService), edit the schema to your need, change the settings, and require it from whatever file you want.
