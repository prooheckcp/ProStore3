# PlayerObject

The PlayerObject is a class that gets returned when calling the GetPlayer function.

All the functions showed above should be inherited into the playerObject allowing you to use that at any point.

:::tip Tip

The PlayerObject is specially useful when modifying multiple elements in the player's data.

```luau
local ServerScriptService = game:GetService("ServerScriptService")
local ProStore3 = require(ServerScriptService.ProStore3)

local playerObject : ProStore3.PlayerObject = ProStore3.GetPlayer(player)
local level : number = playerObject:Get("Level")

print("Level, ", level)
playerObject:Set("Level", 3)
print(playerObject:Get("Level"))
playerObject:Increment("Level", 2)
print(playerObject:Get("Level"))
```
